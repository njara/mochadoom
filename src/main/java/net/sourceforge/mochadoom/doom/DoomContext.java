/**
 * Since a lot of stuff requires shared/global access to
 * the WadLoader, the Renderer, the Video system etc. and
 * we're trying to depart from the global/static mentality,
 * a common sharing is required. Ideally, this would be a perfect
 * example of where multiple inheritance could be adopted, since most
 * stuff needs to share this status anyway. The next best thing is
 * to have local references of any used fields in the classes that use them.
 * <p/>
 * About generics: T refers to the type of the graphics resources, and is
 * currently byte[], as all graphics resources are 8-bit indexed. There are
 * no plans that this will change anytime soon. Some classes should allow
 * different types in theory, but it would be too complex and pointless to
 * make everything fully compliant at the moment.
 * <p/>
 * V refers to the type of DISPLAY, and can be 8-bit (byte[]), 16-bit (short[]
 * for HiColor and lesser modes such as ARGB4444, etc.), and, in the future,
 * int[] (truecolor).
 * <p/>
 * The general approach is sharing as much code as possible between different
 * implementations (e.g. rendering code), and only specialize methods/classes when
 * the abstraction of generics isn't enough (typically, when you have to assign
 * directly to primitive arrays or deal with primitive method signatures).
 * <p/>
 * Classes that have specialized code for indexed and hicolor modes should be top-level
 * classes in their package, and contain two nested, static, extending classes called
 * Indexed and HiColor e.g. new MyClass.Indexed() and new MyClass.HiColor(), while any common
 * code should reside in MyClass.
